# QuizzApp Okstate CS 4570

This web app was made as a capstone project at Oklahoma State University in the Spring 2017.

The application is intended to help auto-grade CS 1 assignments and maybe in the future other courses as well.
The app will offer free public CS problems to annonymous users as well.

Instructor: Dr. David Cline
